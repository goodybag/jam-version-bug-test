#Testing Jam's Version

I came across an issue trying to pull down the latest version of my jam package. It kept on pulling across verion 1.0.3 when I had 1.0.5. Then I realized jam was showing my package was v1.0.333. So 333 is greater than 5 so it kept on pulling that.

I've since unpublished that version to correct the problem, but I thought I'd verify it with this package.
